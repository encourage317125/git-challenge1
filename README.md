# Fullstack.io Engineering Git Challenge

At Fullstack, we use `git` with branches to contribute new features. You'll be expected to merge your changes in alongside others and deal with merge conflicts along the way, if they come up.

An important tool for using git is `git rebase` and this challenge will test your ability to use it properly.

## The Challenge

There are two pull requests open on this repo. The changes in each pull request are in a branch and each branch adds a new feature to the app.

The challenge is to use `git rebase` to add _both_ changes to `master`.

When you are finished, your `master` branch should have three commits in the following order:

```
* feat: add reverse
* feat: add uppercase
* init
```

_Any errors, missing features, missing tests, or failing tests will disqualify the solution._

## Instructions

How to attempt this challenge:

1. Create a new repo in _your_ Github account and note the git url
2. Clone this repo
3. Solve the challenge
4. Set your new repo as the origin: `git remote set-url origin ${your repo url}`
5. Push your solution to your repo

You must follow these steps for your solution to be accepted -- **forks or other methods will not be considered**.
